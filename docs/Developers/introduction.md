# Developers section

The following section is intended for those developers who want to implement Gura, if you are implementing a parser, a serialization/deserialization tool, a content generator in Gura format, or any other project that uses this language, this section is for you!

If you are looking for the language specifications to use in your projects, you can check the [official specifications][specs] or use an [existing implementation][implementations].

This section will detail the basic structure that your future implementation should cover, such as the data types, errors that should be thrown in certain situations, conventions, etc. Some resources that may be useful are also provided.

If you are a designer and you are looking for official resources for your designs, you can check the [Resources section][resources] where the official logos are available for free usage.
