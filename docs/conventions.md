# Conventions


## Filename extension

Gura files should use the extension `.ura`.


## File naming convention

As with keys, file names should have short, all-lowercase names and underscores can be used if it improves readability.


## MIME type

When transferring Gura files over the internet, the appropriate MIME type is `application/gura`.


## ABNF grammar

A formal description of Gura's syntax is available in the [ABNF section][abnf].


## License

Gura is distributed under the terms of the MIT license.
