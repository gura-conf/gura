# Gura

Gura configuration language. By [JWare solutions][jware-organization].

<!-- TODO: change yaml markdown when Gura is accepted as a configuration language -->


## Objectives

Gura aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to its similarity with YAML. The key of the language is that there is one and only one way to do things. That feature make it ease to learn, parse, implement and understand.


## Standard errors

The Gura specifications define the semantic errors that should be thrown in certain situations to define implementation-agnostic behavior so that you can receive the same type of error regardless of the programming language from which you are using Gura.

Each type of error will be mentioned in the respective sections.
